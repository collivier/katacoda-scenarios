In this scenario, you will play with
[CNF Test Suite](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-testsuite/). It firstly
highlights all manual steps vs [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) and then creates
a new test case vs [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) based on the
[Functest Kubernetes](https://github.com/opnfv/functest-kubernetes) driver.
