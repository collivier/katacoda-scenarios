You're free to hack any existing XtestingCI playbook as the ones listed in
[README](https://github.com/collivier/ansible-role-xtesting)(e.g.
[Run CNTT Kubernetes Based Reference Conformance](https://www.katacoda.com/ollivier/courses/xtestingci/))
to leverage Kubernetes.

Many other public XtestingCI playbooks listed in
[README](https://github.com/collivier/ansible-role-xtesting) would be
continously added in this series.

Stay tune!
