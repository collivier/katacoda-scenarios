CNTT RC2 forbids you to comment a few test cases as you did to save time. It's
worth mentioning that there is no additional test configuration needed for the
remaining ones.

It should be noted that CNTT RC1 asks for the same operations. You
rather download
[the CNTT RC1 test case list](https://git.opnfv.org/functest/tree/ansible/site.cntt.yml?h=stable%2Fkali)
and handle the OpenStack creds instead of kubeconfig.

Many other public XtestingCI playbooks listed in
[README](https://github.com/collivier/ansible-role-xtesting) would be
continously added in this series.

Stay tune!
