In this scenario, you will smoothly deploy your
[CNTT RC2](https://github.com/cntt-n/CNTT/tree/stable/elbrus/doc/ref_cert/RC2)
toolchain via [XtestingCI](https://github.com/collivier/ansible-role-xtesting)
and then run a subset of the mandatory
[CNTT](https://github.com/cntt-n/CNTT/blob/stable/elbrus/doc/gov/chapters/chapter01.md)
test case list.

Feel free to start with
[deploy your first Continuous Integration toolchain](https://www.katacoda.com/ollivier/courses/xtestingci/firstci)
as a first scenario.

Many other public XtestingCI playbooks are listed in
[README](https://github.com/collivier/ansible-role-xtesting).
