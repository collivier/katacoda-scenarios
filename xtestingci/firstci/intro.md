In this scenario, you will smoothly deploy and configure a test scheduler
(Jenkins) to run the Xtesting samples. All the test results will be published
in your own test result database (MongoDB) and all the test artificats in your
own s3 repository (Minio). A statuspage (Cachet) will quickly highlight the
overall results.
