As highlighted by the previous scenarios, Xtesting is a simple framework to
assemble sparse test cases and to accelerate the adoption of automation best
practices. It mainly allows the tester/developer to work only on the test
suites without diving into
[Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
which would require additional skills.

In the same mindset, XtestingCI also generates all the jobs needed to package
automatically your testcases in docker containers from a git repository. All
these jobs can scan your deliverables to detect any vulnerability and even run
the patchset verification before merge (a.k.a Gates).

It's worth mentionning that all 3000+ upstream jobs needed by Functest and
Xtesting are generated by XtestingCI from a
[single yaml file](https://github.com/collivier/ansible-role-xtesting/blob/master/tests/jjb.yml):
- [linters and unit tests](https://build.opnfv.org/ci/view/functest-tox/job/functest-wallaby-tox/30/console)
- [functional gates](https://build.opnfv.org/ci/view/functest-review/job/functest-wallaby-review/22/)
- [docker builds](https://build.opnfv.org/ci/view/functest-docker/job/functest-wallaby-docker/28/)
- [vulnerability scans](https://build.opnfv.org/ci/view/functest-trivy/job/functest-opnfv-functest-smoke-wallaby-trivy/16/console)
